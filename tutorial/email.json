As associate vice president for research, Nowak will work closely with vice president for research Phaedra Corso to encourage, promote, and support innovative interdisciplinary research and scholarship at Kennesaw State. Kennesaw State secured $12.5 million in new external funding in FY2022, representing an 18% increase over new funding received in FY2021. In February, Kennesaw State was again recognized by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education as a doctoral university with high research activity, affirming the school\u2019s status as an R2 institution. \u201cI am excited to be working with the people who are responsible for helping faculty bring in contracts and lending support to faculty to secure research dollars,\u201d Nowak said. \u201cWorking on initiatives with the Office of Research to secure good research facility space and get resources to the faculty. My job is not to do the research; my job is to make sure the faculty can do the research. That\u2019s the most important part of the job, is helping other faculty succeed.\u201d Nowak arrived at Kennesaw State in 2011 and operates his lab in the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology. His research involves the formation and development of muscle, known as myogenesis. This research is aimed at mitigating or reversing the effects of stroke, muscle injury, cancer cachexia and dystrophy disorders. \u201cResearch was definitely an initiative at KSU, and that\u2019s a big part of what drew me here,\u201d Nowak said. \u201cThere were administrators at every level above me that were interested in growing the research enterprise. They wanted to see it grow. I wanted to run a lab and I wanted to teach, so KSU offered me a very unique opportunity to come here. Seeing what has been built has just been amazing.\u201d Nowak has authored or co-authored more than 20 manuscripts and one patent and has been consistently awarded external funding from the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and American Heart Association. Nowak recently secured a 4-year, $135,000/year National Institutes of Health grant to study the genetic program to build muscle in fruit flies. \u201cThe nice thing about working with fruit flies is, the muscles of a fruit fly look and are built the same as a human muscle,\u201d Nowak said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like saying if I open up the walls on a skyscraper and I open up the wall at my house, what do we have? We have studs and we have electrical. It\u2019s the same thing. Maybe the skyscraper is a little bit more complex, but it\u2019s the same principle. If we study and understand how it\u2019s done in the little building, we can then extrapolate how it\u2019s done in the big building.\u201d Nowak earned his Bachelor of Science degree in biochemistry from Michigan State University in 1997 before earning his Ph. D. from Johns Hopkins University in 2003, where he studied the regulation of gene expression. Nowak completed a postdoctoral appointment at the Skirball Institute of Biomolecular Medicine at the NYU Langone Medical Center, then served as a postdoctoral fellow of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, studying muscle development.

Sarah Guindre-Parker Guindre-Parker has earned a three-year $369,303 grant from the National Science Foundation to study heavy metal concentrations in starlings, a common bird found throughout metro Atlanta. \u201cI'm hoping to better understand how urbanization contributes to some of the heavy metals that are found in our environment,\u201d she said. \u201cIn cities, there are more houses with lead paint, and we used to put lead in our gasoline, so theoretically all of that lead should be more concentrated in the city, but it\u2019s unclear how that actually plays out in the environment.\u201d Preliminary data indicates that starlings nesting at urban sites have slightly higher lead concentrations in their systems compared to starlings using a rural nesting site. According to Guindre-Parker, this information can offer even deeper insights into urbanization. \u201cStarlings could serve as a sample for the environment in a location instead of us having to drive and sample soil or water in least 20 different areas,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe a starling could aggregate all that information for us and be used to measure the levels of pollutants that humans face in the same zip code, which is what we hope to do under this grant.\u201d In addition to the study, the grant money will allow Guindre-Parker to expand her research team with more graduate and undergraduate researchers. She also plans to add 10 field study sites around the Atlanta area, including some sites in rural areas. With these new sites, Guindre-Parker and her team will involve local high school science students and teachers in soil sampling and other aspects of the research. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to visit nearby schools and teach them a little bit about the work we do and teach them about heavy metals \u2014 where they're found, what caused them to accumulate in the environment and what their effects are on birds and humans alike,\u201d she said. \u201cWe're hoping to also sample their schoolyards and make sure that their soils are safe for them. So, I think that's another exciting part of the grant that will tie in nicely to the research and the student training.\u201d Guindre-Parker said Kennesaw State\u2019s location on a border between urban and rural areas makes it ideal for this research, and for her research into starlings overall . She noted that KSU draws students from both urban and rural settings interested in in this research, and several professors and researchers in the College of Science and Mathematics study the effects of urbanization on the environment. \u201cKSU is well-situated to tackle this type of question and to be a front-runner on the topic of urbanization research,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s cool because it also spans our student population, so it can draw more people into the type of research that we\u2019re doing. Everyone can find something interesting or relevant to their lives in that type of research.\u201d The grant began Aug. 1 and funding runs through July 31, 2025. \u2013 Dave Shelles Photos by Jason Getz Related Stories Kennesaw State honors student researchers in annual Birla Carbon Scholars Symposium Kennesaw State researcher receives grant to study pollution effects in birds Kennesaw State adding program to diversify biomedical sciences A trio of Kennesaw State students spreads the gospel of ecology and conservation through engaging social media content A leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its nearly 43,000 students.

As traffic rumbled overhead, they stopped under a crack in the concrete ceiling and shined the light, pausing at the sight of a few small, furry bodies seemingly stuck in the tight space. \u201cThere they are,\u201d Ferrari said, setting up the ladder. Ferrari climbed the ladder carefully, reached up into the crack and then gingerly extracted tricolored bats one by one with a gloved hand. She placed a bat into a protective sack and handed it to Upton, who noted each bat with a Sharpie marker on the outside of the bags. Steps away from the culvert with tools brought from the lab, they would weigh and measure each bat, take fur samples, evaluate the condition of their wings, and take a few other measurements as well. But their most important mission is to look at the bats\u2019 exposed skin, primarily their muzzles, feet and wings for any trace of a white substance that has proven deadly for these nocturnal creatures. A killer in the caves Pseudogymnoascus destructans is the fungus that causes white-nose syndrome (WNS), a disease that has killed tens of millions of bats in the past decade. The fungus takes hold while the bats hibernate during the winter, killing them slowly. \u201cThis is a continent-wide problem,\u201d Ferrari said. \u201cThis work is important, and it\u2019s amazing that our lab gets to be a part of finding a solution to this disease.\u201d Kennesaw State\u2019s BioInnovation Laboratory stands at the forefront of research into WNS. Headed up by associate professor Chris Cornelison and postdoctoral researcher Kyle Gabriel and housed within the College of Science and Mathematics, the scientists focus primarily on the fungus and employ both graduate and undergraduate students in their efforts. While the lab\u2019s portfolio also includes research into mushroom cultivation and additional emerging fungal pathogens, none of those has attracted the same level of attention and funding of the research into WNS, a problem Cornelison has described as \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d They have partnerships with the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The DNR holds permits allowing the researchers to conduct surveys at multiple sites around the state under their guidance. Since founding the lab in 2017, Cornelison and Gabriel have received nearly three-quarters of a million dollars in funding for their work on WNS. The most recent is a $90,000 grant from the Bats for the Future Fund that will go toward the construction of an artificial hibernaculum in Rabun County, Ga., to simulate the caves and culverts where bats hibernate, in order to better investigate the efficacy of the treatment methods they\u2019ve developed to mitigate the deadly fungus. \u201cBats provide a number of ecological benefits. One of these is eating large amounts of insects, including many crop pests,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cThanks to bats, we can reduce the amount of toxic pesticides being applied to crops and the environment. Bats fill a unique niche and provide a significant economic and ecological benefit, not only to humans but also other wildlife.\u201d According to the University of Georgia Center for Agribusiness and Economic Development, agriculture is a $70 billion per year industry in the state. Additionally, a 2011 study published in Science Magazine estimated the value of bats to the U.S. agricultural industry to be between $3.7 billion and $5.3 billion per year, which accounts for the reduced cost of pesticides no longer needed due to the insects consumed by bats. A self-professed conservationist, Cornelison approaches the WNS problem from the viewpoint of conservation and acknowledging the importance of all species. Bats have inherent value to the ecosystem, he said. Kyle Gabriel and Chris Cornelison \u201cOrganisms have value based on biodiversity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that they exist alone presents value worth maintaining those populations. Biodiversity is the most precious commodity on the planet. If there is a way that we can reduce human-mediated species loss with our expertise, it is incumbent upon us to do that. That\u2019s my personal ethos.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s expertise takes in many aspects of science, including engineering and invention, as evidenced by the building of the artificial hibernaculum. Cornelison and Gabriel developed chemical formulations to kill the fungus in the environment and on the bats while they hibernate. The formulation combines two commercially available liquids \u2014 B23 and decanal \u2014 that demonstrate significant inhibition of the WNS fungus while having low toxicity to mammals. Gabriel modified an industrial aerosolizer that can autonomously spray an extremely fine mist of the formulation in the hibernaculum without disturbing the bats. The aerosolizer is pulled \u2014 slowly \u2014 into the hibernaculum by an electric winch and pulley system attached to a small boat. Cornelison\u2019s lifelong love for wildlife led to his interest in bats, and his doctoral project helped him learn about the importance of bats to the ecosystem. He wrote his doctoral dissertation on the fungus that causes WNS and shortly thereafter received his first grant. He also worked as a postdoctoral researcher with the U.S. Forest Service, focusing on the mitigation of WNS. That doesn\u2019t make his job any easier, however. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to work in conservation biology because everything is dying and things we try to save species sometimes don\u2019t work,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I know why it matters, which makes me even more cognizant to it not working, so I focus even harder on finding solutions.\u201d Promising signs Gabriel said the data indicate their efforts might be working. From 2017 to 2022, the bat population at Black Diamond Tunnel in north Georgia roughly doubled to a population of 362 at the latest count in January. As with any aspect of science, the process is ongoing and will take years to claim success. Cornelison credits the efforts of his fellow researchers at Georgia DNR and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and undergraduate and graduate students from throughout the College of Science and Mathematics, with advancing the study and providing a constant flow of new energy and perspectives toward solving the problem. Both Ferrari and Upton are in the Masters of Science in Integrative Biology program with theses focused on bat research. Ferrari\u2019s thesis involves how various types of bat hibernacula affect susceptibility to WNS, while Upton\u2019s thesis involves research into the microbiomes found on bat wings. Upton presented at the National Council on Undergraduate Research hosted by KSU in 2018, where she met Cornelison for the first time and, after discussing her project and learning about the BioInnovation Lab, realized that she belonged in the lab and at Kennesaw State. \u201cI had mostly done genetic barcoding and population genetics work before, but I was slowly getting more excited by wildlife diseases,\u201d Upton said. \u201cSince the BioInnovation Lab had projects dedicated to studying white-nose syndrome, I figured it was a good fit and came to study under Dr. Cornelison. I never aimed to study bats for a career, but this is where research has taken me and I love it.\u201d At the culvert last fall, Ferrari and Upton worked with four researchers from Georgia DNR. That day, they processed 15 bats, finding no evidence of WNS. Both Ferrari and Upton held the tiny, flying mammals in their hands, examining them one last time before letting each go. Almost immediately, the bats flew back into the culvert, where they would spend the winter hibernating. \u2013 Dave Shelles Photos by Jason Getz Related Stories Kennesaw State honors student researchers in annual Birla Carbon Scholars Symposium Kennesaw State researcher receives grant to study pollution effects in birds Kennesaw State adding program to diversify biomedical sciences A trio of Kennesaw State students spreads the gospel of ecology and conservation through engaging social media content A leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its nearly 43,000 students.

L to R: Ayse Tekes, Amir Ali Amiri Moghadam, Turaj Ashuri Principal investigator and assistant professor of robotics and mechatronics engineering Amir Ali Amiri Moghadam, associate professor of mechanical engineering Ayse Tekes, and SPCEET\u2019s interim assistant dean for academic affairs Turaj Ashuri were recently awarded a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to research ways of improving heart surgeries through the use of tiny robots. The three-year, $364,220 grant will fund their project, \u201cDesign and Fabrication of Soft Parallel Robots for Transcatheter Interventions.\u201d \u201cThis award represents an opportunity to greatly benefit society, and I\u2019m proud that three of our faculty members and their students will be part of the research,\u201d SPCEET Dean Ian Ferguson said. \u201cHeart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, and this project will be a significant step forward in helping surgeons with their patients.\u201d The goal of the project is to create a tiny soft robot that will fit inside a catheter and be delivered to the heart. The robots are nimble, precise, versatile, and valuable in multiple procedures, including heart valve repair, atrial fibrillation, and intracardiac echocardiography. \u201cDeveloping this new device can reduce the impact of heart failure on patients\u2019 lives and those around them, and it helps to lengthen life and promote a healthy society,\u201d Amiri Moghadam said. More than 650,000 people die from heart disease each year in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The three most common cardiac interventions are open-heart surgery, robotic-assisted heart surgery, and transcatheter interventions. \u201cBecause transcatheter interventions do not require cutting the heart open, they can revolutionize the treatment of cardiac disease,\u201d Amiri Moghadam said. \u201cThey cause significantly less trauma to patients and typically involve less recovery time and a reduced risk of infection.\u201d Upon successful completion of this project, heart surgeons will have access to a novel, efficient device for planning and studying new procedures for transcatheter heart surgery. Over the next three years, Amiri Moghadam will oversee the design group, Tekes will supervise and train graduate and undergraduate students on the development of the soft robot, and Ashuri will lead the finite element team to optimize the structure of the robot. The three principal investigators also plan to develop a new, technical elective course called \u201cDesign and Development of Soft Robots for Biomedical Intervention\u201d for Kennesaw State students interested in this type of work. \u2013 Abbey O\u2019Brien Barrows Photos by Matt Yung Related Stories 3D Printing Ecosystem transforms education at Kennesaw State University Four Kennesaw State students awarded scholarships from U.S. Department of Energy Kennesaw State professor awarded NSF grant to explore brain-inspired computer vision Kennesaw State student selected for highly competitive State Department fellowship A leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its nearly 43,000 students.

Through dedicated \"threads\" (aka themes) within the event, companies can raise awareness of opportunities for students to work with them, increase brand awareness, and locate top talent for computing workforce. Students can hone their skills, apply the knowledge they gain inside the classroom in authentic, real-world problems, and connect with internship and job opportunities. Come together with friends and other students, meet new people, strengthen your design and development skills, and connect with companies eager to identify talent and see what you can make\u2026 all within one weekend. This hackathon will strengthen your resume, let you apply what you are doing in the classroom into rea-world scenarios, and let you connect with employers for possibly internships, part time and full time job opportunities. The CCSE Hackathon is open to all KSU students. For students that do not already have a team, don't worry! We will pair you with a team based on your strengths and weaknesses. This is an excellent opportunity to hone your skills. Each industry sponsor will present challenges related to their thread of industry. Multiple challenges are possible for each sponsor. In each of these challenges, students will be chosen to form teams of 3 or less to solve these challenges presenting the best of our students in Computer Science, Information Technology, Software Engineering, Game Development, and KSU as a whole. Many different skillsets on every team are desired for the best results for our industry leaders. The offical CCSE Discord channel will be the main platform for sponsor mentoring during the Hackathon. Each sponsor will have their own unique channel and students participating in their challenge will be able to join. The CCSE Executive Discord Leadership Team will place students in the appropriate channels based on the Hackathon Teams spreadsheet provided by Professor Dawn Tatum as students check-in.

Restricted or classified research produces results that are not shared broadly. Fundamental research is not subject to export controls when conducted within the borders of the United States. However, fundamental research of any kind occurring abroad is subject to export controls if restricted equipment, software, or information is shipped outside the United States. Export controls are restrictions imposed by the federal government on access to, dissemination of, and transfers of some equipment, software, and data. Providing access to restricted technology or information to those who are not either American citizens, legal residents, or other protected persons while in the United States or while abroad may be considered as an export, re-export, or deemed export. Any item that is sent from the United States to a foreign destination is an export , including software or other technology, design plans, and technical information. The term \u201cdeemed export\u201d refers to the disclosure or release of such items or information to a foreign national within the United States. Principal investigators of projects involving foreign nationals, travel outside the United States, or items shipped outside the United States (including software or other technology, design plans, and technical information) need to consider whether or not their work is subject to export control restrictions. The implications of federal law governing restricted technologies and the involvement of foreign nationals in research or shipment of items outside the United States must be discussed with the Office of Research during the early stages of proposal planning. Violations of export controls can result in major fines against the institution and imprisonment of those individuals held responsible for the violations .

Sarah Guindre-Parker Guindre-Parker has earned a three-year $369,303 grant from the National Science Foundation to study heavy metal concentrations in starlings, a common bird found throughout metro Atlanta. \u201cI'm hoping to better understand how urbanization contributes to some of the heavy metals that are found in our environment,\u201d she said. \u201cIn cities, there are more houses with lead paint, and we used to put lead in our gasoline, so theoretically all of that lead should be more concentrated in the city, but it\u2019s unclear how that actually plays out in the environment.\u201d Preliminary data indicates that starlings nesting at urban sites have slightly higher lead concentrations in their systems compared to starlings using a rural nesting site. According to Guindre-Parker, this information can offer even deeper insights into urbanization. \u201cStarlings could serve as a sample for the environment in a location instead of us having to drive and sample soil or water in least 20 different areas,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe a starling could aggregate all that information for us and be used to measure the levels of pollutants that humans face in the same zip code, which is what we hope to do under this grant.\u201d In addition to the study, the grant money will allow Guindre-Parker to expand her research team with more graduate and undergraduate researchers. She also plans to add 10 field study sites around the Atlanta area, including some sites in rural areas. With these new sites, Guindre-Parker and her team will involve local high school science students and teachers in soil sampling and other aspects of the research. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to visit nearby schools and teach them a little bit about the work we do and teach them about heavy metals \u2014 where they're found, what caused them to accumulate in the environment and what their effects are on birds and humans alike,\u201d she said. \u201cWe're hoping to also sample their schoolyards and make sure that their soils are safe for them. So, I think that's another exciting part of the grant that will tie in nicely to the research and the student training.\u201d Guindre-Parker said Kennesaw State\u2019s location on a border between urban and rural areas makes it ideal for this research, and for her research into starlings overall . She noted that KSU draws students from both urban and rural settings interested in in this research, and several professors and researchers in the College of Science and Mathematics study the effects of urbanization on the environment. \u201cKSU is well-situated to tackle this type of question and to be a front-runner on the topic of urbanization research,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s cool because it also spans our student population, so it can draw more people into the type of research that we\u2019re doing. Everyone can find something interesting or relevant to their lives in that type of research.\u201d The grant began Aug. 1 and funding runs through July 31, 2025. \u2013 Dave Shelles Photos by Jason Getz Related Stories Kennesaw State honors student researchers in annual Birla Carbon Scholars Symposium Kennesaw State adding program to diversify biomedical sciences A trio of Kennesaw State students spreads the gospel of ecology and conservation through engaging social media content Saint-Louis's undergraduate experience at Kennesaw State prepared him to return as faculty member A leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its nearly 43,000 students.

All MTAs and DUAs are legal contracts between KSU and the providing (or receiving) entity, and as such must undergo review by various divisions on campus. You should budget enough time to complete this process and obtain signatures before your research materials or data sets can be transferred or purchased. There are stipulations for contracts with vendors and other entities that may hold up approval of your MTA/DUA. Specific details are found in this document from the Division of Legal Affairs. These are the most common issues that will need to be addressed if found in the agreement: Legal name: The correct legal name of KSU for inclusion on the agreement is \u201cBoard of Regents of the University System of Georgia by and on behalf of Kennesaw State University.\u201d No indemnity clauses are permitted, since Georgia law prohibits state entities, including schools within the University System of Georgia, from agreeing to such terms. This is typical of state and federal governmental entities. Georgia law prohibits state entities from entering into contracts that identify another state\u2019s, municipality\u2019s, or country\u2019s law as the governing law. If any changes to the contract are requested by campus entities, it will be necessary to reach out to the providing or receiving entity to secure approval of the language or request the necessary edits. This can add several days to the process as we wait for a response. If you wish to have an MTA/DUA signed by the Vice President for Research, acting as the Institutional Official, please complete the following: Fill out either the MTA form or the DUA form (links below), supplying as much information as you have available. Contact information for an appropriate person at the other institution or vendor will be needed to arrange for approval of needed edits and to gather final signatures. Please make every effort to provide this information in order to make the process more efficient. As the researcher, you are likely more familiar with the institution or vendor than anyone else on campus. Fill out any needed information on your MTA/DUA relating to the researchers and items or data involved. A Word document or other editable copy of the agreement is preferred, in case additional changes are needed. Please do not provide a PDF version of a Word document. Do not sign the agreement or gather any signatures from your department or college leadership if indicated on the form. Send 1) the completed form and 2) an unsigned copy of the MTA/DUA to researchcomp@kennesaw.edu . After we receive your information, we will submit the agreement for review and approval through the Contract Management System. You can then expect the following: Review by the different campus divisions: approx. 5 business days. If edits were requested, we will send the document for review and approval by the other institution/vendor. After review and approval, your agreement will be circulated for signatures via DocuSign and then a signed copy will be available to you. Please allow at least two weeks for this process, and potentially longer if the agreement is international or significant changes or negotiations are required. If the other institution is a signatory to the Uniform Biological Materials Transfer Agreement , please email Research Compliance to find out the next steps. If you require assistance creating an MTA to share materials with another institution, please email Research Compliance . We can provide you with templates that can be customized for your purposes. If you have any additional questions, please email researchcomp@kennesaw.edu .

Working in the laboratory of assistant professor of chemistry Graham Collier, Charland-Martin discovered a substance that made polymer materials degradable while retaining properties effective for electronic applications, such as solar cells or thin films for sunglasses. \u201cPolymers currently available are usually not reusable or recyclable, or they\u2019re made through less eco-friendly methods,\u201d said Charland-Martin, an Honors student in the Double Owl program who is also pursuing a master\u2019s degree in chemical sciences . \u201cBy designing these polymers with a degradable building block, we can maintain their effectiveness and make them more environmentally adaptable.\u201d Charland-Martin\u2019s research followed the path of other studies in Collier\u2019s lab, which are aimed at simplifying the process of making polymers for electronic and light-related applications. In the spring, the College of Science and Mathematics selected 10 students to each receive a $4,000 stipend to pursue research during a summer program established by Birla Carbon, a worldwide chemical manufacturer. The 10 scholars were chosen based on the recommendations of faculty members, submission of an undergraduate research project abstract, and a GPA of 3.0 or higher. Recipients worked with their sponsoring faculty members on their proposed research projects in six departments within CSM. This year\u2019s scholars, their majors and their faculty mentors included: Riley Bennett , chemistry major, mentored by Mark Mitchell, professor of chemistry and biochemistry Ariane Charland-Martin , chemistry major, mentored by Graham Collier, assistant professor of chemistry Noam Lewit , chemistry major, mentored by Mohammad Abdul Halim, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry Kieran MacDonald , physics major, mentored by Kisa Ranasinghe, associate professor of physics Lauren Massaro, physics major, mentored by Mahmoud Asmar, assistant professor of physics David Melcher , biology major, mentored by Mohammad Abdul Halim, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry Sandra Nguyen , biology major, mentored by Brandon Carpenter, assistant professor of molecular biology Isabel Ouko , mathematics major, mentored by Glenn Young, assistant professor of mathematics Kailen Parks , chemistry major, mentored by Martin Hudson, professor of biology Connor Welch , chemistry major, mentored by Michael Stollenz, associate professor of inorganic chemistry Since 2014, funds provided by Birla Carbon have enabled 93 Birla Carbon Scholars to participate in research. In 2019, Birla Carbon reaffirmed its pledge to the program by extending the agreement for another five years and adding $275,000 to the commitment. Terence Norman, director of human resources in the Americas at Birla Carbon, said the company looks forward to this event every year to showcase young scientists. \u201cJust when I think this symposium can\u2019t get any better, it exceeds my expectations,\u201d Norman said. \u201cI saw some truly impressive presentations here today, and I know the future is bright for these researchers. Congratulations to all the scholars. Your hard work is paying off.\u201d Along with the $4,000 stipend each scholar received, Charland-Martin received an additional $2,000 in travel funds to present her research at a national or regional conference.

Know More, Borrow Less. In the Fall of 2018, University System of Georgia Chancellor, Steve Wrigley, launched an initiative to ensure students are aware of their student loan debt. The Know More, Borrow Less (KMBL) initiative supports the USG\u2019s three primary objectives: graduate more students, be more affordable and be more efficient. This initiative is designed to reduce barriers to aid, improve students\u2019 understanding of borrowing and reduce student debt. To support this initiative, a \u201cdebt letter\u201d will be electronically sent in a mobile-friendly format to every enrolled student who currently has student loan debt resulting from federal or state loan programs, or private lender borrowing. Students will receive both a text and an email providing them a link to a personalized letter containing specific information on monthly payments based on their current loan amounts. Each academic year, students will receive a debt letter, updating them on their cumulative student loan debt. The Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid will have analytics to review the open rate of these messages to ensure students are receiving the information.

Kennesaw State University accounting faculty Dana Hermanson, Rich Clune, and Marcus Caylor are among the authors on the list. Marcus Caylor Published since 1982, the journal hosts academic articles evaluating the impact of accounting on public policy decisions and vice versa. The authors of the upcoming article, \u201cThe Journal of Accounting and Public Policy at 40: A Bibliometric Analysis,\u201d looked at all 885 articles and reviews featured in the journal and ranked them based on the number of times they were cited in other papers. Based on this review, Caylor\u2019s 2006 article, \u201cCorporate Governance and Firm Valuation,\u201d was ranked No. 5. Meanwhile, \u201cEnterprise Risk Management: An Empirical Analysis of Factors Associated with the Extent of Implementation,\u201d written by Hermanson, the now-retired Clune, and Mark Beasley of North Carolina State University in 2005, was ranked No. 22. Michael J. Coles College of Business Dean Robin Cheramie said the recognition from the journal reflects the quality of the College\u2019s faculty. \u201cThis achievement reinforces the incredible faculty we have in our College who are able to produce significant research and make a difference in the discipline,\u201d she said. \u201cI am proud of their achievements and contributions to the accounting profession.\u201d School of Accountancy Director Steve Smalt praised both Hermanson and Caylor for their continued work expanding accounting knowledge. \u201cDana Hermanson and Marcus Caylor continue to be two of the most prolific authors publishing in top quality accounting peer-reviewed journals,\u201d Smalt said. Dana Hermanson Hermanson, the Dinos Eminent Scholar Chair of Private Enterprise and Professor of Accounting, said he is honored to have his work cited as among the most influential in the journal\u2019s history. \u201cWe provided one of the very early looks into enterprise risk management, and I think this paper became one of the foundational papers for researchers interested in that topic,\u201d said Hermanson. \u201cIt helped to lay the foundation for future research, and I am happy that our early study has been helpful to so many others doing work in this area.\u201d Caylor, professor of accounting, whose featured article was co-written by then-Georgia State University professor Lawrence Brown, is grateful to the Coles College leadership for providing him with continued support throughout his journey as a researcher. \u201cMy work has been influenced by Coles College in numerous ways,\u201d Caylor said. \u201cThe excellent colleagues I have had a chance to work with both within my department as well as across departments, the emphasis of Coles College research on informing the profession, and the support I have received from the director of the School of Accountancy and the dean have been invaluable.\u201d \u2013 Daijah Sims Related Stories 3D Printing Ecosystem transforms education at Kennesaw State University Kennesaw State named top institution for cybersecurity outreach Kennesaw State student earns leadership role with international organization Treasure trove donated to Kennesaw State's Music and Entertainment Business program A leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its nearly 43,000 students.

In accordance with these regulations, the University has the responsibility to disclose, manage, reduce, or eliminate any actual or potential conflicts of interest that may be presented by a financial interest of an investigator. As part of our conflict of interest policy, we require that faculty with outside support for their research and a COI reporting requirement complete training. Our training is available through CITI, and is valid for 4 years. Please see the instructions below to add the COI course to your CITI profile. COI CITI Instructions on Course Selection (PDF) KSU has a uniform policy for financial conflicts of interest in research. Reporting requirements vary by research sponsor, but our annual disclosure requirements are the same for all researchers, to ensure that we comply with all potential sponsor\u2019s regulations. Please note that you still need to report outside activities through the portal on OwlExpress. The FCOI policy for research only fulfills the reporting requirements of research sponsors, and will not communicate any outside activities to your Chair or Dean. Financial Conflict of Interest Policy for Research All researchers must disclose their significant financial interests as defined in the policy at least annually. Please log in to the Cayuse Research Suite to complete your annual disclosure. Please note that this is not the same server that is used for IRB submissions. The module is called \"Outside Interests.\" All faculty are granted access to Cayuse automatically, via your NetID and password. A walkthrough of the disclosure procewss is provided below. Instructions for completing the disclosure are provided below. Please contact researchcomp@kennesaw.edu with any questions about COIs, and service@kennesaw.edu with any technical issues. Cayuse works best with Chrome or Firefox. Log in to Cayuse Research Suite The National Science Foundation currently requires grant recipients to file specific COI disclosures for each funded project. Please log in to the Cayuse Research Suite and complete a \u201cResearch-based Disclosure\u201d if you are applying for NSF funding or are otherwise requested to do so by Sponsored Programs. Cayuse also has a robust support website that is free (registration required) with information and walkthroughs of different tasks. These are also accessible through the help icon (Orange question mark) at the bottom right when you are logged in to Cayuse.

The event gives students from Georgia\u2019s colleges and universities an opportunity to present their research to state leaders. This fourth annual event is an initiative of the Georgia Undergraduate Research Collective (GURC). \u201cWe are so pleased to have five KSU students accepted to this event by Georgia legislators,\u201d said Amy Buddie, director of undergraduate research at KSU. \u201cWith the introduction of the \u2018Advancing Community and Culture\u2019 pillar to the Roadmap to R2 success, this event helps show our state\u2019s decision-makers that students at KSU and elsewhere are conducting meaningful, relevant research that makes a difference in our community.\u201d The selected KSU students are Destini Chambers, Jessie Chen, Gabrielle Jones, Nathaniel Jones and Luci Wilgus. Their research presentations will cover a range of disciplines. Brains and motion Destini Chambers Chambers, a junior studying engineering, is looking at the prediction of intent to start and stop movement by using Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from the brain. She is using that data to create a Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) system that can be used in vehicles to protect pedestrians. \u201cI was initially fascinated by the analysis of the human brain and how to examine its fluctuations during the decision-making process,\u201d she explained when asked why she was influenced to conduct this research. Analysis of redistricting Jessie Chen As a senior studying computational and applied mathematics, Chen attended a Faculty Research Spotlight, a series of research talks intended for undergraduate students in the mathematics department, featuring Dr. Andrew Wilson. The research topic focused on applying mathematics to redistricting of congressional districts. Through Chen\u2019s research, she was able to gain valuable experiences in seeing how math can be applied outside of the classroom. \u201cI was able to get a glimpse into how mathematical research is done and see the significance of coding in computational mathematics,\u201d she said. \u201cDuring the process of this research project, I felt that what we did was directly related to the real world, which was a nice addition to this experience.\u201d Diversity on television Gabrielle Jones Gabrielle Jones\u2019 will present her work with a focus on screenwriter, Chris Nee, and her work to diversify children's television. As a sophomore studying media and entertainment, Jones explains, \u201cGrowing up, I never saw people who looked like me on screen; through this research project, I get to uplift women who have done amazing work but are not getting credit for it.\" Her presentation highlights a woman whose work to increase diversity in children's television led to educating youth in better ways to create new conversations and tell new stories. \u201cDoes the Pell Grant come with a Price?\u201d Nathaniel Jones Pursuing a master\u2019s in applied statistics and analytics, Nathaniel Jones\u2019 research explores the differences in academic outcomes, debt accumulation and school-type of post-secondary schools with either a majority or minority proportion of students receiving a Pell Grant. Through the experience of this research project, Jones gained experiences in presenting, public speaking, networking with other student researchers at conferences, and collaborating with his mentor Susan Mathews Hardy, senior lecturer of statistics. Curating history Luci Wilgus Wilgus, a freshman anthropology major, is conducting research on best practices for information storage, cataloging, and accessibility. The secondary research required includes arranging individual printmaking equipment in terms of origin, model, and estimated age of each piece. \u201cThe opportunity to be a curator appealed to me as I am interested in using my degree in anthropology to work in a museum setting,\u201d explained Wilgus. \u201cI have always been fascinated by antiques and the arts.\u201d \u2013 Meagan Lowney Related Stories Kennesaw State honors student researchers in annual Birla Carbon Scholars Symposium Kennesaw State researcher receives grant to study pollution effects in birds 3D Printing Ecosystem transforms education at Kennesaw State University Weeks of Welcome A leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its nearly 43,000 students.

(Jul 2, 2020) \u2014 Luis Cuevas has always considered himself to be a Disney fan. He spent his childhood watching all of the classic films and says his favorite book is The Ride of a Lifetime, a memoir written by longtime Walt Disney Company chief executive Bob Iger. So when he learned of Kennesaw State University\u2019s new Disney Interactive Entertainment Study Program, the journalism student leapt at the opportunity to apply his studies toward learning the magic behind a company he has long admired. \u201cI knew that gaining an insider\u2019s perspective on how an industry leader works was going to be a key takeaway for me,\u201d Cuevas said. \u201cThinking through how a brand like Disney continues to grow and adapt was something that has always inspired me, and this course was exactly what I needed to challenge my creativity.\u201d Cuevas was one of nearly 30 students who recently took part in the program offered by the Joel A. Katz Music and Entertainment Business Program (MEBUS) and the College of Computing and Software Engineering (CCSE). Conceived as an affordable \u201cstudy away\u201d option, the four-week program is designed to give students a deep dive on how Disney and its many properties continue to pioneer world-changing entertainment technology. In its original format, students would study on campus for three weeks and spend one week at Walt Disney World to learn how the company applies the technology in its theme parks to generate unforgettable experiences. As part of the program, students were allowed to choose from four courses with topics including 3D modeling and animation, and entertainment media production. While the coronavirus pandemic ultimately prevented students from visiting the parks this year, CCSE Dean Jon Preston said the program stayed the course by offering students an interdisciplinary approach to studying the Disney creative process, albeit remotely. \u201cOne of the core elements of this program \u2013 whether it was from a video production, creative adaptability, 3D graphics or animation standpoint \u2013 was looking at best practices for Disney and studying the kinds of experiences they are known to create,\u201d he said. \u201cWe still hung on to that Disney approach to excellence in the courses, which was paramount for our students.\u201d Keith Perissi, MEBUS director and senior lecturer of music entertainment, said the program is the result of a longtime collaboration between MEBUS and CCSE. Though they are different courses of study at Kennesaw State, he said students representing the two are able to bond over a common language: technology. \u201cWhen you mix those two worlds together, it\u2019s like magic,\u201d Perissi said. \u201cI\u2019m proud of our students for being able to pivot and make this a really unique experience.\u201d Perhaps no course made the pivot easier than one in creative adaptability, he added. The course is designed to help students understand the business of creativity by giving them hands-on experiences in project building. For the Disney Interactive Entertainment Study Program, this meant learning how Disney was able to work through its own creative process to adapt to the onset of COVID-19. Midway through the course, students were treated to a live video call with Dan Cockerell, a longtime Disney employee who most recently served as vice president of the Magic Kingdom Park. Cockerell shared with the class his own experiences within the Disney brand and imparted advice on harnessing the creative process. The course culminated with students taking Disney properties, such as Pixar, Lucas Films and Marvel, and generating pitches for how those properties could be repurposed into short films, feature films or television series under the constraints of the pandemic. \u201cThe course really taught me how to look at things from a different perspective and learn how to create under atypical circumstances,\u201d said Skylar Cleland, whose project focused on the backstory of Frozone from \"The Incredibles.\" \u201cIn a way, I think COVID-19 enhanced this course and challenged us to think outside the box. It was memorable not only for the challenge it presented to me, but to also see how creative my classmates could be with their own projects, and I really hope to see them all come into fruition one day.\u201d Erin Lyles, a public relations student who chose to pitch a new Pixar short film that explores the colors of someone\u2019s aura, said the program has forever changed the way she approaches a project. \u201cMy final project was super impactful to me because I think I made it a lot more personal than I had intended to do,\u201d she said. \u201cIt helped me grow, and it is something that will always be on my mind until I make it a reality.\u201d Written by Travis Highfield Photos submitted Contact Info Kennesaw Campus 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 Marietta Campus 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 Campus Maps Phone 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) kennesaw.edu/info Media Resources Resources For Current Students Online Only Students Faculty & Staff Parents & Family Alumni & Friends Community & Business Related Links Libraries Housing Financial Aid Degrees, Majors & Programs Registrar Job Opportunities Campus Security Global Education Diverse & Inclusive Excellence Sustainability Accessibility Follow KSU 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) \u00a9 2022 Kennesaw State University.

Less \"windshield time\" means more time for virtual visits, so if I haven't been to your school, maybe this is the time. I'm very willing to learn the remote software that your school uses, so please check my calendar and let me know how I can help! We at the College of Computing and Software Engineering will continue to support our K-12 partners in four ways: Content specifically developed for virtual learning Development of new content for virtual learning Existing content applicable to virtual learning Synchronous live presentations using KSU's Blackboard Collaborate Ultra, Microsoft Teams, or your school's presentation tool. Content ready for virtual learning is listed immediately below. For development of new content or to schedule a synchronous live presentation, please contact me directly at Bob.Brown@Kennesaw.edu . Content Specifically Developed for Virtual Learning Find the Pok\u00e9mon: The Importance of Algorithms (Grades 5-9) In this video, we learn about the importance of algorithms and choosing the right algorithm for a given task by playing a \"Find the Pok\u00e9mon Game.\" Along the way we meet Bill and Gina, school kids who play along with us. We discover two different algorithms for finding a hidden Pok\u00e9mon and learn when to choose one over the other. This video can be played online or downloaded. Handout, game sheets, and transcript are included. 18 minutes. Best Practices for Academic Success (Grades 9-college) In this eight-minute video, Dr. Brown recalls the advice he gave students in his classes about note-taking and studying. Transcript and slides are available with the video. Introduction to Binary Numbers (Grades 3-5) Students make their own binary counting cards, then learn to manipulate binary numbers following instructions in a video. This video can be played online or downloaded. Handout, printable counting cards, and transcript are included. 13 minutes. Existing Content Applicable to Virtual Learning Binary Numbers (Grades 6-8) A narrated video and additional content to help teachers present virtually. Boolean Logic: Kat's Cat Checker Narrated video and additional material. Cryptography Narrated video and additional material. Cryptography, Exploring Further Narrated video describing the Vigen\u00e8re Cipher, handouts with exercises, and links to Wikipedia. About Dr. Brown Dr. Bob Brown, a retired KSU faculty member, can present the following at schools or other locations in the Atlanta area. For dates, please see his availability calendar . These presentations are geared toward middle school and high school students, but can be adapted for other audiences, including elementary school students. Contact Bob at Bob.Brown@Kennesaw.edu for details or to schedule a presentation or get my vCard or public key . Bob is a Raspberry Pi Certified Educator . Presentation Topics Algorithms and searching: This is a single 50-minute presentation based on the Battleships activity from CS Unplugged , revised to use Pok\u00e9mon instead of battleships. Students work in pairs to locate each other's Pok\u00e9mon, first performing a linear search, then a binary search, and, time permitting, a hashed search. The concept of algorithm is introduced and formally defined. Students learn that some algorithms are more efficient than others, and Big-O notation is introduced briefly. The lesson concludes with a discussion of the importance of selecting the correct algorithm. Curriculum elements include comparing numbers for equality and inequality, coordinates, algorithms, efficiency of algorithms, and searching. Binary numbers: This is a single presentation of about 50-minutes that introduces binary numbers. It was designed for grades 6-10, but has been presented successfully to third-graders. The session outline and objectives are included in the teacher notes . If I present this, I will furnish a set of binary counting cards for each student, but we ask schools to duplicate the handout. I have fun presenting this, and I hope you'll invite me to do so, but I've packaged it into a teachers' kit that will let teachers present it independently with minimal pre-work. Boolean Logic: Kat's Cat Checker: This is the logic-only part of the Digital Logic series, condensed to a one-period presentation. Katherine, Kat for short, is headed to Hogwarts, and uses logic to specify the ideal cat to take with her. This may be best suited to grades 8 to 12. Careers in computing: This is a 15- to 50-minute presentation, depending on the time available, in which I discuss a number of careers in the computing field and end by suggesting that students also consider becoming a college professor. Coding fundamentals with Python: This one is under development at a middle school; help me work on it. I'm working on a presentation of about eight or nine contact hours. I'm looking for another school to work with me. Cryptography, introduction: A single 50-minute session that introduces substitution and transposition ciphers, beginning with the C\u00e6sar Cipher. Students decrypt a message encrypted with the rail-fence cipher, then create a keyword substitution cipher. The presentation is available as a narrated-slide video . The accompanying handout is available as a PDF . Cryptography, public key: A single 50-minute presentation that demonstrates the workings of modern public key cryptography, including digital signatures. This one is all lecture, with no classroom activities, and so is best suited to grades 10-12. There is a take-home exercise in which students generate their own public/private key pair. Cryptography exercises: These are optional exercises for students who want to go beyond the exercises in the handouts. The exercises cover the Vigen\u00e8re cipher, the one-time pad, and public key cryptography. Digital logic: I've presented this several times with refinements after each. It shows students that there's no magic in computers. There is an outline and objectives document available; I am very willing to adapt it to your curriculum. Handouts for all three days are available to download, and there's a video of day 3. Students need a basic understanding of binary numbers. This might fit best in grades 8 to 12. This requires the free software package Digital Works. If installation of software is a problem, I can bring copies for each student on CD. Information Security : This is a series of three presentations with a target audience of grades 7-10. It is probably best to do these once a week or every other week for three or six weeks rather than all at once. The three sessions are Information Security Fundamentals, Encryption, and Threat Analysis. There is more detail in the outline and objectives. Micro:Bit: This is a series of eight 50-minute sessions in which students learn the fundamentals of programming using the Micro:Bit device. Programming differs from \"coding\" in depth and breadth. Students learn \"coding\" and also some of the science behind software development. Raspberry Pi : What we can do depends on the school's objective, the equipment available, and the time available. If you have Raspberry Pi equipment, I can help your teachers get ready to use it in the curriculum. I can work directly with students to get them started building Raspberry Pi projects. I can help your school start a Code Club and provide some assistance in the operation of the club. If the Raspberry Pi is new to you, it's a $45 computer that can be used for making physical projects. The $45 is for a bare computer; you will end up spending $80-200 per pair of students to equip a Raspberry Pi lab. I've prepared an annotated shopping list to help you get started. The Raspberry Pi Foundation has more details. Sphero SPRX: I'm working with a middle school to teach block programming to sixth graders using the Sphero environment. The program will be eight or nine lessons, and I'm looking for a second school to work with me. Need something else? I am very willing to prepare new material to suit your needs or curriculum. Contact me and we can probably work something out. I'm also available to help with curriculum development, professional development, and the development of learning objects. Contact me at Bob.Brown@Kennesaw.edu to work out the details. Details There is no fee for any presentation, but we do ask that schools duplicate any handout material that may be required. When I present at a school, a teacher must be present at all times and be responsible for classroom management. The presentations listed are designed for a room with a projector and a Windows computer that can show PowerPoint with video and sound. If you let me know, I can bring a suitable laptop with HDMI video and audio output. I can also present without audiovisual aids if you give me plenty of notice.

Jones is one of 88 students from across the country who will participate in the highly competitive event presented by the Council on Undergraduate Research. Students are selected based on a review by a panel of experts in their field. Pursuing a master\u2019s in applied statistics and analytics in the School of Data Science and Analytics , Jones\u2019 undergraduate research was conducted with input from his faculty mentor Susan Hardy, senior lecturer of statistics. Jones explores the differences in academic outcomes, debt accumulation and school-type of post-secondary schools with either a majority or minority proportion of students receiving a Pell Grant. \u201cMy message to legislators and even school officials is that incoming freshmen need to know what it means to be financially dependent on their parents versus independent and how to correct if they are misclassified,\u201d Jones said. \u201cDependent student loan debt is more than double that of independent students.\u201d Even before Posters on the Hill, Jones has received interest in his research from members of Congress. Rep. Lucy McBath\u2019s legislative aide, Matthew Golden, is taking the idea of instituting Pell Grant safeguards to committee. This week Jones has meetings scheduled with Sen. Jon Ossoff, Rep. Barry Loudermilk and Rep. Sanford Bishop. Jones was also one of five Kennesaw State students who presented research projects to state legislators and other officials at the Georgia Capitol as part of the Posters at the Georgia Capitol event on March 30.

He earned an associate degree at another university and worked for a few years to support himself before pursuing a bachelor\u2019s degree at Kennesaw State. \u201cAt one point, I was working two jobs and going to school,\u201d Uduka said. \u201cJuggling those responsibilities was difficult, but I persevered because my dream has always been to obtain my bachelor\u2019s degree and work in the information technology field.\u201d Through the fellowship, Uduka will complete a domestic internship in Washington, D.C. in the summer of 2023 and an international internship at a U.S. embassy or consulate in the summer of 2024. \u201cI\u2019ve had an interest in computers and information technology since I was little,\u201d said Uduka, who is a member of the Mu Alpha Theta Honor Society and fluent in both English and Igbo. \u201cThis fellowship will allow me to work with different systems and will give me the opportunity to work with diverse cultures and languages.\u201d After successfully completing the program, fellows receive appointments as Foreign Service information management specialists, for a minimum five-year commitment, and will use technology skills to support U.S. diplomacy abroad. \u201cThis fellowship attracts top technology talent in the nation, and to be selected is an incredible accomplishment,\u201d CCSE Dean Sumanth Yenduri said. \u201cWe look forward to watching Prince\u2019s successes with the State Department.\u201d In the 2022 cohort, Uduka is one of eight undergraduate students selected for the fellowship. This summer, he will attend orientation and begin the State Department\u2019s security clearance process. \u2013 Abbey O\u2019Brien Barrows Photos provided by the Washington Center for Internships and Academic Seminars Related Stories 3D Printing Ecosystem transforms education at Kennesaw State University Kennesaw State awarded NIH grant to improve heart surgeries through use of robots Kennesaw State Academy for Inclusive Learning grad built skills for rewarding career Kennesaw State economic impact increases to more than $1.8 billion in fiscal year 2021 A leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its nearly 43,000 students.

Breedlove, a junior computer science major in the College of Computing and Software Engineering (CCSE), will live in Orlando for three months and work as a software engineering intern with Walt Disney Attractions Technology. April Breedlove \u201cI\u2019m going to be living out my dream,\u201d said Breedlove, who transferred to Kennesaw State this fall after graduating high school early. An experience in Disney World three years ago shaped that dream and changed the trajectory of her life. In 2019, Breedlove was one of 100 high school students nationwide accepted into the exclusive Disney Dreamers Academy (DDA). The four-day, all-expenses-paid trip introduces students from underrepresented communities to all the opportunities Disney provides through career workshops and mentoring sessions. \u201cI thought there was no way I would get in,\u201d Breedlove said, after her first application was denied. \u201cBut growing up, my mom always said, \u2018Never let fear stop you from doing what you want, because you don\u2019t know what you could be missing.\u2019 I\u2019m so glad I followed that advice and applied again.\u201d At DDA, Breedlove joined the technology Deep Dive, a personalized small group based on participants\u2019 career interests, where she worked on Disney\u2019s Magic Bands. The w aterproof wristbands allow guests to unlock their hotel room, enter theme parks, pay for food and much more by tapping the band to a touch point sensor. \u201cPrior to my experience in the Disney Dreamers Academy, I didn\u2019t know that Disney needed software engineers,\u201d she added. \u201cI left that Deep Dive knowing I wanted to return.\u201d Two years after DDA, Breedlove was rushing to class on Kennesaw State\u2019s Marietta campus when she saw a booth set up for the student organization Girls Who Code. Students at the booth said they were hosting a career fair and a recruiter from Disney was going to be there. Breedlove attended the career fair and eagerly put together her Disney Professional Internship application. A few weeks later, she received a call from a recruiter. \u201cShe told me they wanted me to join the team as a software engineering intern and I started crying,\u201d Breedlove recalls. \u201cThis has been my dream since high school, but little did I know there would be more.\u201d As she wrapped her mind around starting her dream internship, Breedlove was surprised to get an email from DDA staff asking her to return to the Academy and mentor the newest group of high school students. \u201cI wanted to have an individual impact on every student in my group,\u201d Breedlove said after she returned to campus. \u201cI really focused on making those connections, because connections at DDA and KSU are what helped get me to this point.\u201d When she returns to Orlando this summer, she will intern with the same team that inspired her three years ago. \u201cThat Deep Dive in high school sparked everything for me,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the speakers called it a \u2018destiny moment\u2019 where you realize what you want to do and what you want to be. I\u2019m looking forward to more of those moments this summer.\u201d \u2013 Abbey O\u2019Brien Barrows Photos by Judy Pishnery Related Stories Making Their Mark: Newest KSU alumni are ready for the world Spring 2022 Commencement Kennesaw State student presenting research to Capitol Hill officials Kennesaw State students use technology to connect young adults with mentors A leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its nearly 43,000 students.

In the past year, we have made substantial progress in research growth and productivity thanks to the accomplishments and ongoing efforts of our faculty, staff, and students. As you know, we have had to adapt to new teaching and learning modalities, as well as develop enhanced research safety protocols in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. During this period, the number of research proposals submitted increased over this time period relative to the previous year, which demonstrates the perseverance, flexibility, and creativity of our faculty. In response, we have increased the number of staff in Sponsored Programs Administration and streamlined processes with Cayuse, a more robust and efficient grants management system. The Office of Undergraduate Research and the Office of Research Development and Strategic Initiatives continue to thrive and successfully transitioned their programming to an online format when needed. We are excited to welcome everyone back for the spring semester, including a new influx of students, faculty, and staff. With the health and safety of our KSU community as the top priority, we have updated our COVID guidelines for on-site research activities in accordance with the University System of Georgia\u2019s policy on masks and social distancing as prescribed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In returning with expanded in-person operations, our mission and goals as an office remain the same \u2013 to support faculty and students in every possible way so they may engage in important and innovative areas of scholarship. Through our resources and services, we strive for Research, Integrity, Compliance, Objectivity, and Transparency, with an additional focus on Customer Service. Everything we do is guided by the principles in the Roadmap to R2 success . It is our hope, that in following these goals for promoting interdisciplinary research with relevance, we can bolster our trajectory as a top-tier R2 institution. We look forward to continuing many of our exciting programs and activities such as the spring edition of the Symposium of Student Scholars and a new season of Research with Relevance \u2013 this time focused on a Chairs and Directors\u2019 Showcase. These events will be hosted on a virtual platform. We are also launching a new office focused on economic development and community engagement and two new research centers: the Center for Innovation in STEM Education Research and Center for the Advancement of Military and Emergency Services Research (AMES Research). Additionally, we will be working on activities related to the recent National Institutes of Health grant KSU received to enhance the university\u2019s diversity and research infrastructures in the biomedical fields. We invite you to explore the various services that our divisions and research centers and institutes offer to determine how we can support your research plans and ensure your success. We also encourage you to claim and update your PIVOT profile to explore new avenues for funding and collaboration.

KSU's College of Computing and Software Engineering (CCSE) provides academic advising for prospective and current students in both undergraduate and graduate programs. Click on any of the options belows to get started! Undergraduate Advising Graduate Advising Frequently Asked Questions Q. How do I select or change my major? A. When ready to declare your new major, log into OwlExpress and select \"Declare/Change Major or Minor\" under the Student Records menu. Some degree programs have particular requirements in order to be admitted to the major. That is why we advise you to always talk to an advisor before requesting a change of major. CCSE Academic Advising Office is here to help you make the right decision \u2013 or choose one of several possible right decisions. Make an appointment to talk to us if you are thinking of declaring your CCSE major, switching between CCSE majors, out of CCSE or into CCSE. If you know that CCSE majors are not right for you but you have no idea what else you may be interested and good at, you may want to schedule an appointment with an UCAS advisor for undecided and exploratory students. KSU is proud to offer free access to YouScience \u2013 an integrated aptitude, interest inventory and career match assessment. Your CCSE academic advisor can provide you with an access code and help you interpret the results of the YouScience assessment. YouScience will help you gain insight into who you are and what your talents are and how these align with college major and career choices; it is also a great tool to use when preparing resumes, cover letters, and elevator speeches to land the internship or job you covet. Q. How do I add a minor? A. If and when you decide on a minor, after consulting with an academic advisor from the college or department offering the minor, you can declare it by logging into OwlExpress and selecting \"Declare/Change major or minor\" under the Student Records menu. Please note that students in the Applied Computer Science program (now discontinued) are required to choose a minor or concentration area as part of their major. The KSU catalog lists all formal minors offered at KSU and specifies their requirements under the Academic Programs section. Minors usually range between 15 and 18 credit hours, with at least 9 hours of non-duplicative credit required. Your academic advisors are here to help you in your decision and respective planning. Q. How do I speak with my academic advisor? A. Undergraduate students can visit the Undergraduate Advising page , where they can arrange to speak with a CCSE Academic Advisor in person, by phone or by virtual appointment on Microsoft Teams. Graduate students can visit the Graduate Advising page and reach out to the director of their graduate program. To get the most out of your interaction with us, please review the CCSE academic advising conspectus . Q. How do I resolve a prerequisite and test score error? A. If you attempt to register for a class that you don't meet the prerequisites for, you will receive a prerequisite and test score error. Sometimes, you will receive this error even if you meet the prerequisites. Often this happens when you have transfer credit that meets the prerequisite or if there has been a course substitution, but there can be other reasons. If you believe you have met the prerequisites for a STAT, DATA, CS, CSE, SWE, CGDD, or IT- prefixed course and are receiving a prerequisite and test score error when attempting to register, please complete this form \u2013 this is the fastest way to resolve the issue, especially during busy periods such as registration and add/drop. If you are receiving this error for a course that is not taught at the College of Computing and Software Engineering, please contact the respective college for resolution. Q. How do I remove a registration hold? A. Registration holds require students to take certain actions prior to registration for the next semester. They will prevent you from registering for courses, so it is recommended you resolve them prior to the start of registration. If you have an Advising Hold , a scheduled meeting with an academic advisor for your current or intended major will resolve it. All Freshman students (0-29 credits completed) have a registration hold placed on their account each semester. We email all students with this hold, inviting them to schedule an appointment to meet. It is important to read the advising hold email in its entirety, as it includes instructions on actions students need to complete before meeting with a CCSE advisor. Often there is a worksheet , or a file containing important information attached to this email. If you have another type of registration hold, please consult this information page about resolving it. Q. How do I request a repeat court override? A. If you attempted a KSU course twice \u2013 withdrawals do count as attempts \u2013 and want to register for it for the third or subsequent time, you need to obtain permission to do so. The process of requesting a repeat course override is designed to help you succeed at your third attempt. If you want to be allowed a third or subsequent attempt at a course prefixed with STAT, DATA, CS, CSE, CGDD, IT and SWE, please complete this form . You may be invited by email to meet with a CCSE academic advisor to discuss your success strategy prior to the override being issued \u2013 make sure you check your student email regularly. If you want to request permission for another attempt for a Math or Science (BIOL, CHEM, or PHYS) course, please review the College of Science and Math course repeat request policy and procedures . If you want to request permission to repeat a course from another college (such as ENGL, POLS, HIST, ECON, etc courses) you may contact directly an advisor from the college offering the course (for example, College of Humanities and Social Sciences for ENGL, POLS, HIST courses). If you are unsure who to contact, let us know \u2013 we will gladly connect you with the right person. Q. How do I give feedback on advising? A. We love hearing back from our students. Please fill out this form to submit feedback.

To that end, our college offers high-quality academic programs in Computer Science, Applied Statistics, Data Science and Analytics, Software Engineering, Information Technology, and Game Design and Development at the undergraduate, masters and doctoral levels.

Student Success Possessing computer skills and feeling comfortable online does not necessarily ensure your success in an online course. A common theme in online courses is self-discipline and persistence. At Kennesaw State, we are committed to helping our online students achieving their academic best. Online Student Success Frequently Asked Questions What are the benefits of online learning? Online learning provides considerable freedom, allowing students to often choose when and where they'll participate in class activities. Save time and money spent commuting to a campus Continue working at your current job while you are taking classes Attend your class from anywhere as long as you have a high-speed Internet connection Learn at your own pace and study at your convenience Learn new technologies Interact on equal footing Students will have the same kinds of deadlines and structured responsibilities of a face-to-face class. In other words, flexibility must be balanced by responsibility. Like a face-to-face course, online courses require assignments be completed by due dates, your attendance (via logins to your course), involvement in online discussions, and sometimes group collaboration. Most students enjoy the active learning that online classes involve. What are the challenges of online learning? Self-motivation and discipline are required to succeed in distance learning courses. For many, distance learning offers access to education not previously available. It also provides a solution to flexibility needs, work and travel responsibilities, and family challenges. A successful experience in distance learning requires a basic familiarity with technology. Resources are available for students through University Information Technology Services for those interested in distance learning, but in need of a technology refresher. It is also strongly recommended that students have ready access to a computer or laptop with a high-speed Internet access, such as DSL or cable broadband. Online courses will require students to download and access course materials. Online learning success depends on preparation, motivation, dedication, and planning. What equipment and technology will I need to be successful at online learning? Online learners will need a computer, Internet access, basic software (such as Microsoft Office Suite, Windows Media Player, Quicktime movie player, anti-virus protection and a compatible browser), and auxiliary equipment (such as a webcam and microphone headset for video-based communication). Of course, technology needs will vary by course. But this list applies to the majority of courses. Computer: Online Learners will need reliable access to a desktop or laptop computer that has adequate memory and processing capabilities for large file downloads, video players, and synchronous meeting applications. Auxiliary Equipment: The Digital Learning Innovations team also strongly recommends a WebCam and Headset for video-based communication. Many newer laptop or monitor set-ups are pre-equipped. These items may be required by faculty on a course-by-course basis. Internet Access: Online courses at KSU use the web to deliver courses at a distance. So, to learn in an online course smoothly, you need a high-speed Internet connection (such as DSL, Broadband, etc). This is especially important to the online learning experience. Software: While this will vary by course, you will need a recent version of the Microsoft Office Suite. Access to MS Word, MS PowerPoint, and MS Excel are expected and necessary for viewing course material or completing assignments. Additional requirements include anti-virus protection, Windows Media Player, QuickTime movie player, and a compatible browser. Visit UITS Training for additional information on software training, compatibility, and available downloads. HAVE MORE QUESTIONS?

No matter where you choose to visit us, we hope you\u2019ll love Kennesaw State University as much as we do. Academic Advising Advisors assist you in identifying and achieving your academic, career, and personal goals. They provide academic guidance in order to keep you on track for graduation and can help connect you to campus programs and services. You are assigned an academic advisor, or advising center, based on your intended major. We encourage you to meet with your advisor at least once each semester. Advising is not registration! You should meet with your advisor prior to the date you register for classes so you can discuss the best plan for the upcoming semester and beyond. Academic Advising Frequently Asked Questions How do I find out who my advisor is? You are assigned an advisor based on your intended major. Exploratory/undecided students are seen by Owl Advising, and students who have a major already identified are seen by the advisors in that department. In many cases, your advisor will be viewable in DegreeWorks. How do I know when it\u2019s time to register each semester? The best way to plan ahead is to access the phased registration dates on the Registrar\u2019s site . If these are not up to date, you can also click on the academic calendar to view many important dates for the University including the beginning and ending of each phase of registration. The first available time for you to register can be found by logging into Owl Express . How do I change my major? You can change/declare your major in Owl Express under the \u201cstudent records\u201d tab in Owl Express. What classes are required for my major? Each major has a specific list of required classes for graduation. Current KSU students should check DegreeWorks for this list. DegreeWorks is a web-based tool through Banner Web that provides real-time information on degree progression. DegreeWorks lists the courses you are required to take to complete your degree at KSU. This is available to you 24/7. Login to Owl Express (enter your KSU ID & Pin) Select the Student menu. Select DegreeWorks \u2013 Degree Audit. Your declared major worksheet will automatically load. There is also a \u201cWHAT-IF\u201d tab that gives you an unofficial view of how your credits will apply to a different major. (NOTE: If you officially change your major, you will be moved to the most recent Catalog regardless of when you started classes at KSU.) DegreeWorks does not replace face to face advising. You should continue to meet with your advisor to discuss degree-related concerns. Prospective students should contact the major department of interest for degree information. How do I find out about financial aid? Information on financial aid, including loans, FAFSA, Hope, and work-study opportunities, can be found online at the KSU Financial Aid site . How do I find out about scholarship opportunities? Your department may be aware of additional scholarships related to your field of study. In addition, the KSU library contains books with information with various scholarships and grants. Is there someone I can talk to about different career options? The Department of Career Planning and Development would be a great place to start. Additionally, the Counseling and Psychological Services Center conducts career and academic counseling. Finally, your advisors can help you see how your undergraduate major can lead you to many different careers. FIND YOUR INTEREST At KSU, our colleges are dedicated to our students.
